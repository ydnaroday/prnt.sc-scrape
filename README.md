# prnt.sc-scrape
Small toy program that will get random images from the prnt.sc website.

prnt.sc has user screenshots available publicly, probably without the knowledge of its users. Accessing them is easy as almost any random string of characters added to 'prnt.sc/' will load a new image. Be careful when using this script as some of the images are very explicit.
### How to use
* You need python libraries Requests, and BeautifulSoup.
* Run the script via command line and pass in the amount of images wanted as an argument (default is 1).
