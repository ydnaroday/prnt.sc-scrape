# prnt.sc-scrape
Small toy program that will get random images from the prnt.sc website.

Created for education purposes only. This website could contain sensitive images, which could be downloaded by this program. Use at your own risk.

### TODO
* Use a python library instead of wget, although it works just fine.
* Clean up command line argument input.
* Make output prettier.
